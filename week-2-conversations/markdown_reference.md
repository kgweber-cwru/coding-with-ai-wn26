# Markdown Quick Reference (for LLM Outputs)

Markdown is a lightweight way to format plain text.  
You write simple symbols (like `#`, `*`, and `-`) and the platform renders clean formatting (headings, lists, code blocks, links, etc.).

Why this matters in this course:
- LLMs often return answers in Markdown.
- Knowing Markdown helps you quickly read, edit, and reuse model output.
- Markdown is used in GitHub, Jupyter notebooks, docs, and many chat tools.

---

## 1) Headings

Use `#` symbols at the start of a line.

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

Rendered:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

Tip: Most documents use one `# Heading 1` title, then `##` for major sections.

---

## 2) Paragraphs and Line Breaks

- A blank line creates a new paragraph.
- A single Enter usually stays in the same paragraph.
- Two trailing spaces at the end of a line can force a line break in many renderers.

```markdown
This is paragraph one.

This is paragraph two.
```

---

## 3) Emphasis (Bold / Italic)

```markdown
*italic* or _italic_
**bold** or __bold__
***bold italic***
```

Rendered examples:
- *italic*
- **bold**
- ***bold italic***

---

## 4) Lists

### Unordered (bulleted)

```markdown
- Item A
- Item B
  - Sub-item B1
  - Sub-item B2
```

### Ordered (numbered)

```markdown
1. First
2. Second
3. Third
```

Tip: Indent nested list items with two spaces (or four, depending on style).

---

## 5) Links

```markdown
[OpenAI](https://openai.com)
[Course README](../README.md)
```

Format: `[link text](URL-or-path)`

---

## 6) Images

```markdown
![Alt text describing image](images/example.png)
```

Format: `![alt text](path-or-url)`

Why alt text matters:
- Accessibility (screen readers)
- Context when image fails to load

---

## 7) Code Formatting

### Inline code

Use backticks around short code references:

```markdown
Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
```

### Code blocks

Use triple backticks for multi-line code. Add language name for syntax highlighting.

````markdown
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```
````

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

---

## 8) Blockquotes

```markdown
> This is a quoted note.
> You can continue on multiple lines.
```

Rendered:

> This is a quoted note.
> You can continue on multiple lines.

Useful for tips, warnings, or excerpts.

---

## 9) Horizontal Rules

Use three dashes (or `***`) on a line by itself:

```markdown
---
```

---

## 10) Tables (Basic)

```markdown
| Tool | Use Case | Week |
|------|----------|------|
| Chat model | Q&A | 2 |
| Notebook | Coding exercises | 2 |
| Markdown | Documentation | 2 |
```

Rendered:

| Tool | Use Case | Week |
|------|----------|------|
| Chat model | Q&A | 2 |
| Notebook | Coding exercises | 2 |
| Markdown | Documentation | 2 |

---

## 11) Task Lists

```markdown
- [x] Install dependencies
- [ ] Run notebook cells
- [ ] Submit assignment
```

Rendered (on platforms that support task lists):
- [x] Install dependencies
- [ ] Run notebook cells
- [ ] Submit assignment

---

## 12) Escaping Special Characters

If you need to show Markdown symbols literally, add a backslash (`\`).

```markdown
\*not italic\*
\# not a heading
```

---

## Common “LLM Output” Patterns You’ll See

1. **Headings + bullets** for organized summaries
2. **Code fences** with language labels (like `python`, `bash`, `json`)
3. **Tables** for comparisons
4. **Blockquotes** for notes or caveats

When in doubt:
- Copy the output into a Markdown preview (GitHub, VS Code preview, or notebook Markdown cell).
- Look for simple patterns: `#`, `-`, `**`, backticks, `[text](link)`.

## Mini Practice Exercise

Try to read and then edit this Markdown snippet:

````markdown
## Week 2 Summary

In this week, we practiced:
- Prompting a model
- Interpreting **Markdown** output
- Running `python` code in notebooks

> Tip: Ask the model to “format your response as Markdown.”

### Useful command
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
````

Questions for students:
1. Which text is bold?
2. Where is the blockquote?
3. Which part is a code block?
4. Add one new bullet item.

## One-Line Cheat Sheet

- `#` heading  
- `*italic*` and `**bold**`  
- `-` bullet list  
- `1.` numbered list  
- `` `code` `` inline code  
- ````` fenced code block  
- `[text](url)` link  
- `![alt](img.png)` image  
- `>` quote  
- `---` divider

If you can recognize these symbols, you can read most Markdown generated by an LLM.
